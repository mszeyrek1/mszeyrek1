## Hello ðŸ‘‹, My name is Muhammed Settar Zeyrek!

I'm an Applied Computer Science Student at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dortmund and I focus on systems programming with C/C++ and designing the Front-End with JavaFX, as well as cyber security, where I currently try to dive into.

Tools like Git help me versionate these projects.

I use Windows and PopOS Linux and am versed with Kali Linux as well.

Always open to broaden my horizon with new technologies and new fields of Computer Science!
