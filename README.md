## Hello ðŸ‘‹, My name is Muhammed Settar Zeyrek!

I'm an Applied Computer Science Student at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dortmund and I focus on systems programming with C/C++ and designing the Front-End with JavaFX, as well as cyber security, where I currently try to dive into.

Tools like Git help me versionate these projects.

I use Windows and PopOS Linux and am versed with Kali Linux as well.

Always open to broaden my horizon with new technologies and new fields of Computer Science!


ðŸ”­ Projects
- jcprozessmanager: A simple process manager in C to monitor and control system processes, inspired with Unix tools, with the Front-End mostly done in JavaFX (work in progress :D)
- simpleprojects: A collection of fun and small C/C++ projects, like algortithms, and a calculator for example.
- cybersec-portfolio: My experiences doing pentests, write-ups with CTF challenges and ethical hacking scripts(under development).
