## Hello 👋, My name is Muhammed Settar Zeyrek!

I'm an Applied Computer Science Student at Technische Universität Dortmund and I focus on C++-Programming, as well as Machine Learning and AI, where I currently try to dive into.

Tools like Git help me versionate these projects.

I use Windows and PopOS Linux and am versed with Kali Linux as well.

Always open to broaden my horizon with new technologies and new fields of Computer Science!
